# Polymer 3 Preview Project
This is a dumb Polymer 3 preview project that I created for demo in my GDG Devfest Bangkok 2017 session that will give a taste of what Polymer 3 element will be.

## Required dependencies
1. NodeJS and npm
2. Yarn
3. Polymer CLI

## Try it
1. Download it or clone it and then install dependencies with command
```
yarn install
```
2. Serve project with command
```
polymer serve --npm
```
3. Play with it. Edit element. Add more element. Whatever you want! Just Do It!
